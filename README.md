**Contact Form with Validation and SweetAlert**

This project involves creating a contact form that allows users to submit their information. The form is built using HTML and styled with CSS for a clean and user-friendly interface. JavaScript is used to handle form validation, ensuring that all required fields are properly filled out before submission.

Upon successful validation, the form data is sent to a PHP script, which processes the information and stores it in a MySQL database. If the submission is successful, SweetAlert is used to display a visually appealing confirmation message to the user. If there are errors, SweetAlert shows appropriate error messages to guide the user.

**Key Components:**

HTML: Structure of the contact form (e.g., name, email, message fields).

CSS: Styling for a modern and responsive design.

JavaScript: Client-side validation to check for empty fields and proper input formats.

PHP: Server-side script to handle form submission and interact with the MySQL database.

MySQL: Database to store contact form submissions.

SweetAlert: Provides stylish alert messages for success and error notifications.

This setup ensures a smooth user experience with real-time feedback and reliable data handling.
